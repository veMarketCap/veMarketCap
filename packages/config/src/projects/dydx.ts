            'The dYdX exchange is running on top of a layer-2 and allows for decentralized trading that supports multiple financial products such as perpetual, margin trading, leveraged trading, and spot trading. In simple terms, it combines off-chain order books with an on-chain settlement layer to enable trading.',
        benefits: 'Having veDYDX offers a few opportunities for its holders compared to just having DYDX. There could be a time lock model as well, however the exact time yet still has to be determined.',
        voting: 'When voting, veDYDX will be used to account for the amount of votes instead of DYDX. The exact ratio still has to be determined at the time of writing.',
        gaugeWeights: 'There could be a gauge weight system in place which can be used by veDYDX holders to incentivise the liveness of specific markets.',
        rewards: 'The current proposal doesnâ€™t mention anything regarding revenue sharing with veDYDX holders.',
