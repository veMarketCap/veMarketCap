            'APwine is a decentralized protocol and aims to tokenize the future yield so a user doesnâ€™t have to worry about future yield fluctuations.',
        benefits: 'Having veAPW offers a few opportunities for its holders compared to just having APW.',
        voting: 'The veAPW token can be locked up for veAPW for a period up to 2 years. The veAPW will be non-transferable until the lock will expire. Locking the tokens up will grant you the right to participate in the governance process. The more veAPW a user has, the more voting right they will have.',
        gaugeWeights: "Currently the rewards are being distributed evenly over all the pools but there is a governance proposal up to create a dynamic gauge weight. The gauge weight could be voted on every week to determine which pools should get the emission of the APW token.",
        rewards: "Holders of veAPW will get to share in the platform revenue generated by the 0.05% swapfees. This will also include all kinds of other future protocol revenue flows which are not in production yet.",
