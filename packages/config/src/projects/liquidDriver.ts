        description: 'Liquiddriver is a liquidity mining protocol and provides Liquidity-as-a-Service in the Fantom ecosystem. The protocol therefore aims to bring its users more utility, rewards and long-term benefits through the LQDR token. LQDR can be locked from 2 weeks up to 2 years. From the moment it is being locked, the amount of xLQDR will decrease linearly until the tokens can be unlocked again.',
        benefits: 'Having xLQDR offers a few opportunities for its holders compared to just having LQDR.',
        voting: 'The xLQDR token gives the right to vote on proposals regarding the platform. There will also be a voting mechanism in the future in which xLQDR holders can be bribed for their votes.',
