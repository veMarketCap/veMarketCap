            '88mph has a variety of features that make it a good place for earning a fixed yield rate on multiple assets. By depositing your assets the protocol will make sure you will get a fixed yield instead of a variable yield rate.',
        benefits: 'There currently is xMPH but thatâ€™s going to be phased out. Having veMPH offers a few opportunities for its holders, compared to just having MPH of xMPH.',
        voting: 'A user with veMPH will be eligible to vote on governance proposals.',
        gaugeWeights: 'Each 88mph pool will be regularly allocated MPH incentives based on gauge weights. The depositors will earn these incentives automatically when they deposit their assets.',
